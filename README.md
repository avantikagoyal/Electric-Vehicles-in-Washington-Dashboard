# Electric Vehicle Usage Analysis in Washington State

## Project Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends in Washington in 2023, leveraging publicly available data from the State of Washington's open data portal. Our team developed an interactive dashboard using Tableau to visualize these trends, focusing on brand preferences, usage patterns, and the shift towards eco-friendly transportation.

## Objective
The primary objective of this analysis is to offer insights into the growing trend of electric vehicle adoption. By examining data on EV registrations, brand popularity, average prices, and electric range, we aim to serve a broad audience including consumers, industry competitors, policymakers, and researchers. The insights garnered from this analysis are intended to guide consumer decisions, inform competitor strategies, and contribute to the broader discourse on sustainable transportation.

## Methodology
We utilized Tableau for exploratory data analysis and to create interactive visualizations that highlight key aspects of EV usage in Washington. Challenges such as understanding specific terms like MSRP and CAFV, imputing missing MSRP values, and compiling different workbooks into a cohesive presentation were addressed collaboratively by the team.

## Key Findings
A total of 153,830 EVs were registered in Washington in 2023, with over 63% being Tesla models.
The Tesla Model Y is the most prevalent EV on the road.
The average base Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for EVs is approximately $43,000.
EVs have an average electric range of 66 miles, with 77% classified as battery electric vehicles (BEVs).

## Interactive Dashboard
Our Tableau dashboard offers interactive visualizations that allow users to explore various dimensions of the data, such as EV distribution by brand, average prices, and electric range. This tool is designed to provide actionable insights and support informed decision-making for both consumers and industry stakeholders.

## Usage and Contribution
This repository contains the Tableau workbook (*.twb) along with a detailed presentation summarizing our findings. We welcome contributions from the community to extend the analysis, improve visualizations, or suggest new data sources for a more comprehensive view of the EV landscape.
